# RoboPong
Final Project for Robotics Class

## General To Do:
* camera calibration
** get or buy folding ruler
* connect image processing laptop to robot controlling PC:
** TCP connection between our laptop (pyhton?/C++) and Robot PC (C++)
* ball trajectory prediction
** include air friction

## Protocol (Recent progress: green color, New bullet: red color)

### 13/18/2019
* RealSense: runs on Clarissa’s (Linux) and Jakob’s (Windows) laptop
* ball detection: got pixel and depth information from RealSense
* <font color="green">trajectory:</font> Israeli matlab code was transleted to python (not tested yet)
* <font color="green">TCP Server Client:</font> Sent a string message from Jakob's laptop (Python) to Roboter (C++). String message has to be decoded next.
* ask TA for folding ruler
