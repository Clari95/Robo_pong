  Robot Client:
  increase robot speed
  start execution in New_RAS

Camera Server:
open camera socket
listen for camera client...

  Camera Client:
  connect to camera server
  wait for data...
    
    if client connected:
      
      Camera Server:
      define 9 robot coordinates: world_coordinates with X,Y,Z
      for coordinates in world_coordinates:
        MOVP command with coordinates
        wait till coordinates reached (5 seconds)
        send coordinates to Camera Client
        wait till camera coordinates calculated (2 seconds)
      
          if coordinates received:
            
            Camera Client:
              save received world coordinates in array
              for 10 times:
                calculate ball position in pixel x,y and depth (px) -> camera coordinates 1 to 10
              average 10 camera coordinates to balance depth variance
              save camera coordinates into numpy array

      if all world / camera coordinates saved at client:
         
         Camera Client:
         calculate transformation matrix and its inverse (IM)
         print all world coordinates and their prediction via IM*px -> validate results
         
         wait for enter / proceed, if results are satisfying

         start throwing and catching procedure
